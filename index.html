        <div class="answer">Our delivery times are estimates based on your delivery address. Special orders, out-of-stock products and items on back order can all increase delivery times. (This applies particularly to spare parts and suppliers based outside of Denmark.) You can always check on the status of your order by using the link you received after you placed the order. You will receive an email when your package leaves our warehouse. This mail will contain a tracking number that you can use to trace your package online.</div>
